   - `title`: name of the recipe
   - `description`: short sentence about the recipe
   - `time`: estimated time (e.g. "20 min")
   - `difficulty`: one of "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard"

2. **Zero-Waste Recipes** – list of 2 ways to reuse or repurpose leftovers of this ingredient (e.g. near-expired, stale, or byproduct like shells or crusts). Each recipe must include:
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `time`
   - `difficulty`
   - `ingredients`: comma-separated list
   - `instructions`: short preparation steps

3. **Composting Guide** – if the ingredient or any of its byproducts can be composted, return:
   - `tips`: array of 4–5 short composting guidelines
   - `environmentalImpact`: brief description of the benefit of composting this ingredient

Format the response as a clean and valid JSON object:
```json
{

  "suggestedRecipes": [...],
  "zeroWasteRecipes": [...],
  "compostingGuide": {
    "tips": [...],
    "environmentalImpact": "..."
